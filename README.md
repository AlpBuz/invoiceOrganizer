This is an invoice organizer that I created for my father. He owns a mechanic Shop so he has 100s of invoices created for customers, and after
showing him an app where he can turn these invoices into a pdf to be stored on his computer. I created this program for him to easily organize them base of the customers name.
It organizes them on the first letter of their last Name, or if their is no last name from the customer, then the first letter of the customers first name.
